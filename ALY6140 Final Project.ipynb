    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb is popular among both hosts and guests. Hosts want to share their properties for more competitive price or competitive envriomment than hotels in the area. Guests also want to live in a more affordable and friendly way while they are traveling. It is important for us to know what factors can affect the price setting and how we can predict the price based on the selected features of the properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our project idea is from Boston Airbnb Open Data on Kaggle.com published two year ago. We also go to Inside Airbnb to get the updated original data. In this project, we first explore the original datasets provided online. Next, we explore the dataset with our selected features. Then, we clean the data and explore the data again to see the differennce. At the end, we build the price prediction models and see which model is best fit for the predictions.\n",
