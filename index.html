<h2> Guaranteed Social Campaign Based on Targeted Advertising, December 2018   </h2>
<p> Viacom want to offer Guaranteed Social Campaign to their advertisers. For example, Viacom want to guarantee their advertisers 
	that their ads will reach a certain number of views (e.g. 1000 impressions) over a certain period (e.g. a week). Viacom 
	want to charge advertisers $25 per 1000 impressions. This project is to find out whether Guaranteed Social Campaign could be profitable for Viacom.

<h2> Create Word Cloud from txt File, June 2018  </h2>
<p> This is a small project that I do when I first learn about Python. Since most of my projects are about structured dataset, 
	I pick the unstructured data to work on in this project. In this project, I generated work cloud graph in cow shape based 
	on the information in the txt file. The work cloud graph will display the more frequent words in bigger letters and the less 
	frequent words in smaller letters.

<h2> An Empirical Analysis of Tariff Binding, May 2013 </h2>
<p> Binding designed by WTO provides some countries trade policy flexibility and restricts some countries to low flexibility. 
	Bindings vary a lot across countries and sectors. The Beshkar, Bond and Rho model, concerning the mechanism of setting optimal binding, 
	yields some strong predictions and evidence within 66 WTO members. My paper is to further check whether their theory still holds using data 
	from subsample and individual country. I expectedly find that bindings increase in political pressure, and decrease in market power and development 
	level within 14 selected countries. The results are not robust to each individual country. Moreover, the results also support the theory that binding 
	is independent of market power when market power is greater than a certain level. An additional finding is that weighted import concentration outside 
	their theory also has a significant and negative effect on binding.
