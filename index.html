<h2> An Empirical Analysis of Tariff Binding, May 2013 </h2>
<p> Binding designed by WTO provides some countries trade policy exibility and restricts some countries to low exibility. 
	Bindings vary a lot across countries and sectors. The Beshkar, Bond and Rho model, concerning the mechanism of setting optimal binding, 
	yields some strong predictions and evidence within 66 WTO members. My paper is to further check whether their theory still holds using data 
	from subsample and individual country. I expectedly find that bindings increase in political pressure, and decrease in market power and development 
	level within 14 selected countries. The results are not robust to each individual country. Moreover, the results also support the theory that binding 
	is independent of market power when market power is greater than a certain level. An additional finding is that weighted import concentration outside 
	their theory also has a significant and negative effect on binding.
